# winima
WINima is here to make working with Windows 11 easier!

#My wishes about your use of WINima
Well, my idea to create that project came from BonziBuddy (im sure y'all know him). I won't use ChatGPT here, as in most of my programs, instead I will use help from internet and YouTube.
And I beg you, DO NOT PUT WINIMA AS YOUR OWN PROJECT! This is fully mine project, but you can make it better or customize as you want (in this case mention me as original author). In other words, you're free to use it.

#What on earth are 1.0 and 1.1 releases, if it do not contain anything related to help?
Those releases are tests and made to test my update system. You can make it better too!
Do not use these releases as main WINima files, please.

#Commands
In future I'll most likely add more commands, but here's my current plan on commands:
-upd: Simple command that automatically checks for any new release and installs it if exists.\
-updlist: Shows a list of updates and current features.
-help: You know what this command does.
-setup: A command that will help you install a program. Use: "-setup sp=path/to/your/setupfile.exe insp=path/where/youwant/toinstall/app shortcutname="yourshortcutname". SP is path to your setup file, INSP is installation path where You want to install program, SHORTCUTNAME is name of app shortcut on your desktop.
